# Heart Disease Classifier: Project Overview
* Created a heart disease classifier (Accuracy ~92%)
* Engineered features by creating indicator features.
* Tuned and optimized hyper-parameters of Ridge Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, KNN and AdaBoost. 

## Code and Resources Used
**Python Version:** 3.8.2

**Packages:** pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn, pickle
